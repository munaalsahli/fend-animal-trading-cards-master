			<p>The most distinguishing feature of the elephant is its trunk. The trunk is actually the elephant’s nose and upper lip which have joined together. Scientist now believe the elephant’s trunk may contain over 40,000 muscles. At the end of the trunk, the African elephant has two finger-like projections and the Asian elephant has one.
				The elephant uses these projections just like we use our fingers.</p>
